### Prerequisites
* Linux system or MacOS
* Python 3.6, PyTorch version 1.1.0
* NVIDIA GPU + CUDA

### Installation

* Install PyTorch and dependencies from http://pytorch.org

### Test

* Default, using test.py file to synthesize the garment from the images in the example folder. Pre-trained checkpoints download needed and as the instruction in the checkpoints folder to download.
```sh
$ python test.py
```
* Sample results are presented in the example folder.

### Train

* Training process is divided into two parts, the first part is reconstruction, using following command to train first step, and putting the checkpoints to corresponding folder to train second step.
```sh
$ python collarRecon.py --step step1
```

* Second step, using following command:
```sh
$ python collarSyn.py --step step2
```


### Dataset

* The dataset is available online, please download it from the link: https://drive.google.com/open?id=11WMP0uCgzF--Kt18Dwh75Ja-nK1llMcx, and put it under the /data foler.
